# Bookflow
Android app for searching books powered by Open Library's [Search Api](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search). 

The app is created using Square's [workflow](https://github.com/square/workflow-kotlin/tree/main) library

Workflow is a unidirectional data flow library, modeling the app's presentation layer as a state machine.
